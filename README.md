# Album-Art-Collage-Maker
A program takes in a CSV file containing album titles and artists, and outputs a collage consisting of respective cover arts, using the MusicBrainz and CoverArtArchive API's

Simply place the script in a folder with CSV file. The file should contain two columns, the first being the album title, and the second being the artist. Example test file included.

Should any errors arise, please send me an email at ariqishfar2001@gmail.com. Have fun!
